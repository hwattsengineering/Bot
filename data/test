Job Report  005148 / Angus  / 4228 / Corrective maintenance / Dave / 18 Jul 2025 / Calabria Family Wines / Air Liquide	Angus Watts	Corrective maintenance	"Air dryer issues onsite at Calabria 

The site was having issues with a air dryer fault 

After a few days of trying to find the fault codes and contact kaeser with not much luck we sourced a few different spare parts and travelled to site to see. 

I drove to site and spoke to Jon he left the site unlocked so that I could work on the air compressor. 

I found there to be no data or wiring diagrams in the unit and had to fault find a different way. 

I removed all of the covers and inspected the unit it was still running but found the condensing fan to not be controlling. 

I removed the cover and tested the power to the fan and found there to be no power but the bearings working well. 

I then drained the pressure in the buffer and ren the compressor back up to allow for the air dryer to turn back on. 

Once this happened I watched the pressure increase and the fan not trigger this then made me look into the pressure switch that controls the fan. I isolated the unit and found the contractor for this by tracing the cables I unisolated the unit and pushed the contractor in which then made the fan spin. 

This then turned me to fault find the control side of the system

I found the 41 & 42 not getting power which led me back to the pressure switch I removed one pressure switch to the line which triggered the same alarm as what has been happening. 

I then removed the other switch which did not trigger an alarm this told me that it was the fan pressure switch. 

I removed the old switch and dummy wired in the new one which then made the fan control. I searched the site and Ute for some small fittings I needed to make the install tidy. 

I removed the cables and cleaned it up a bit for the night and left site. 

I returned to site the next morning after looking for parts locally without any luck. 

Fan is working and controlling correctly. Compressor ran all night without any issues

Drop in to site on way past to investigate ice machine broken bolts, major failure of 8x m20 grade 12.9 cyl bolts. Seek hyd repairer for advise on possible causes. 

16/7/25-
Return to site and assist Justin onsite with repairs to replace bolts and evenly tighten bolts. Before running machine to check operation discuss with justin possible causes for failure. Go over machine to check for any obvious broken bolts, none found. 
After discussion decided to check machine side 2 parameters for cycle, as it is only on 10mm pelles that its breaking bolts on side 2 only. Found that side 2 10mm pellet parameters had been increased at some point to speed up cycle duration from 20 secs per cycle to around 15-16 secs per cycle. 20-25% increase. Cylce parameters were reset to match side 1 parameters and machine was test run to check side 2 for smooth operation. 
Operation appears to be smooth. 

Appears that the increase in cycle speed is causing excessive increase of pressure insdie the pressing head causing flexion and distortion of the press main body, causing broken bolts in body frame and also cylinder bolt failure due to excessive kick back pressure. 

Machine will be run and monitiored with new lowered operating parameters sticking to a 20 sec cycle time. 
If broken bolts issue continues have discussed with Justin option to removing side 2 module to do full teardown and rebuild. "
